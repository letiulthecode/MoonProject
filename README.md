# MoonProject v0.4 

An **REALLY** Simple "Project manager" made in lua

# Notes

1: Any issues or pull requests are welcome! Dont be shy by
reporting a bug or make an suggestion!

2: This dosent run on windows or non-unix systems,
if you have windows 10 then try to turn on 'WSL' (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
And install a Distro VM.

Also im will work in windows version later, i have other projects to care :)
